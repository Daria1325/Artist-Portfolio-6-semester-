                <p> I do what I love, so when the first buyer came to me and liked my work, I
                    was overjoyed.
                    It was 10 years ago. Since then, a lot has changed, I have changed, as well as my work.
                    My paintings ended up in private collections and galleries.
                    </br>
                    I am glad for every person and company, because through my work we are no longer strangers to
                    each other.</p>
