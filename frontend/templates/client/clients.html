                    was overjoyed.
                    It was 10 years ago. Since then, a lot has changed, I have changed, as well as my work.
                    Over the course of my career, I have been approached by over 200 customers.
                    My paintings ended up in private collections, as well as in galleries, museums and just at houses.
                    </br> I am
                    glad for every person, every company, because through my work we are no longer strangers to each
                    other.</p>
